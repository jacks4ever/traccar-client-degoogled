# Location Permissions Fix - v9.5.2

## Issue Fixed
The Traccar Client Degoogled app was not prompting users to grant location permissions when first installed, which prevented the app from functioning properly as a location tracking application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Android Manifest Permissions
**File**: `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

Added the following location and background service permissions:
- `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` - Basic location access
- `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` - Precise location access  
- `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` - Background location tracking
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` - Required for background services
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION` - Specific foreground service for location
- `WAKE_LOCK` - Keep device awake for tracking
- `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` - Start tracking after device reboot
- `VIBRATE` - Notification vibration
- `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS` - Prevent battery optimization interference

### 2. Permission Request on App Launch
**File**: `lib/main.dart`

Added automatic permission request functionality:
- Added `_requestLocationPermissions()` function that uses the flutter_background_geolocation plugin
- Integrated permission request into app initialization sequence
- Added proper error handling and logging for permission requests

## Technical Details

The fix ensures that:
1. **Permissions are declared** in the Android manifest so the system knows what permissions the app needs
2. **Permissions are requested** automatically when the app first launches
3. **Background location tracking** is properly enabled for degoogled devices
4. **Error handling** is in place for permission request failures

## Testing

This fix should be tested on:
- ✅ Degoogled Android devices (Unplugged, LineageOS, etc.)
- ✅ Standard Android devices with Google Play Services
- ✅ Fresh installs to verify permission prompts appear
- ✅ Background location tracking functionality
