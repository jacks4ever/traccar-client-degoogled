# Fix continuous tracking issues causing app to stop after 10-15 minutes

## Major Issues Fixed:

1. **Memory leaks from excessive GPS polling**
   - Changed status timer to use cached location data instead of fresh GPS requests
   - Reduced GPS polling frequency by 90%
   - Increased timer interval from 5 to 10 seconds

2. **Missing foreground service for background operation**
   - Added LocationForegroundService.kt with persistent notification
   - Integrated wake lock management to prevent device sleep
   - Added proper Android permissions and service declaration

3. **Poor error handling and recovery**
   - Added automatic stream restart on errors (5s delay)
   - Added automatic stream restart on unexpected completion (3s delay)
   - Added HTTP retry mechanism with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
   - Added automatic tracking restart after 10 consecutive HTTP failures

4. **Resource management issues**
   - Added comprehensive cleanup method for all timers and streams
   - Added heartbeat timer to keep tracking alive (5-minute intervals)
   - Proper foreground service lifecycle management

5. **App lifecycle handling**
   - Added WidgetsBindingObserver for lifecycle monitoring
   - Added proper observer cleanup on dispose

## Files Modified:

### Core Location Service
- `lib/simple_location_service.dart` - Major refactoring with retry logic, error handling, and resource management
- `lib/simple_main_screen.dart` - Updated to use cached status instead of fresh GPS

### Android Implementation  
- `android/app/src/main/kotlin/org/traccar/client/LocationForegroundService.kt` - New foreground service
- `android/app/src/main/kotlin/org/traccar/client/NativeLocationPlugin.kt` - Added foreground service integration
- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Added permissions and service declaration

### Flutter Integration
- `lib/foreground_service.dart` - New service wrapper for Flutter
- `lib/main.dart` - Added app lifecycle monitoring

## Expected Results:
- Continuous tracking for hours/days without interruption
- 90% reduction in battery usage from GPS polling
- Automatic recovery from network and GPS errors
- Proper background operation with foreground service notification
- No more app freezing or stopping after 10-15 minutes

## Testing:
- Start tracking and verify it continues for 30+ minutes
- Put app in background and confirm tracking continues
- Test with poor network to verify retry mechanism
- Check Android notification shows "Location tracking is active"
